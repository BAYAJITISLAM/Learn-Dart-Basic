# 🎯 Dart Practice Collection

Welcome to my personal Dart practice repository!  
I'm currently learning **Dart** as a foundation for building mobile apps using **Flutter**.

This repository contains a series of beginner-friendly code snippets based on real-life inspired logic problems. Each file represents a simple task that helped me grasp Dart fundamentals through hands-on practice.

## 💡 Why I Made This

I wanted to **build my programming logic step by step** through small, meaningful problems.  
These are not full applications — rather, they are **focused mini challenges** that reflect real-world scenarios like salary systems, booking apps, smart checkouts, and more.
